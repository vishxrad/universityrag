As Senior Scientiﬁc Advisor to the Government of Himachal Pradesh, he has been responsible for guiding its biotechnology policy. 
I welcome you to a journey of innovation and learning that is bound to transform your life. Shoolini University was seeded with a vision to create a modern learning and innovation village nestled in the Himalayas. Over the past decade, as we built this beautiful ecosystem, each day in the campus has inspired the entire Shoolini community to think and deliver beyond the obvious. As I speak, we at Shoolini have achieved recognitions at national as well as international platforms. I am happy to share that as you become a member of the Shoolini community, you are joining a campus that is already amongst the Top 300 in Asia and the Top 20 in India. I recall our student Vivek Soni, a young boy who joined Shoolini about 7 years back for his master’s programme. He belonged to a small village in Himachal and spent 2 years working on his idea at Shoolini. With that, he received the opportunity to join a f
ully-paid scholarship to one of the leading universities in South Korea. In 2019, while I was visiting Seoul, I received a call from him. He mentioned to me that he has launched a startup in Seoul that is funded by a leading funding agency there. Vishal AnandFounder & Pro ChancellorStories like these are the reason we built Shoolini. Life at Shoolini is very different. While you are here, you get to work with the local communities, solve real-world problems and challenges, experience adrenalin while you trek the peaks surrounding this beautiful campus, or just pick up your camera and start clicking the many moods of the day at Shoolini. We host multiple clubs and peer learning platforms to enable the full potential of your life.My advice to you friends is to really challenge yourselves each day when you are a part of this exciting community.

From outside India, twenty students from South Korean, China, Turkey, Af-ghanistan, Ethiopia and Taiwanese are studying at Shoolini University. On the faculty exchange front, Dr Hyoung–In-Lee, Re-search Professor from Seoul National University and On Cham Lee taught Shoolini B Tech students for a fortnight. A number of foreign teachers are currently teaching at campus. The university has a regular for-eign faculty teaching German and Chinese languages at the campus.• Centre for Excellence in Visionary Learning          Community of India (VLCI)This Centre has been established by Padam Shri Profes-sor Shoji Shiba in collaboration with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Confederation of Indian Industries (CII). The aim of the program is to create gr
eat visionaries/leaders to upgrade the standard of Indian manufacturing sector and to create industry ready students.• Remote Centre for “AAKASH for Education”, IIT          BombayThis remote Centre is running in the school of electrical and computer science engineering. The Centre has ex-cellent infrastructure and good faculty with expertise and experience • Amazon Web Services (AWS) AcademyThis academy provides training and certification model designed to validate the knowledge of professionals as per the growing and changing demands of the IT indus-try. To keep up with the standards, one can take the cer-tification and expect a great rise in terms of position and pay scale of course.

o 
the goal of Shoolini University becoming a research-led organisa-tion. The teaching is by way of interactive sessions between stu-dents and teachers. Our programmes ensure a coherent degree structure while encouraging interdisciplinary approach. The faculty members keep themselves abreast with new findings through regular academic activities such as seminars, workshops and conferences. They have also developed liaisons with research institutions of repute in India and abroad. Their research activities are well-funded through extra-mu-ral research funding from government agencies such as DRDO, DST, etc. Our research-led teaching paves the way for entry into different careers since it equips students with advanced transferable skills in information gathering, analysis and presentation, which are vital tools in the field of science. Graduate and post-graduate students are required to undertake research/ projects.

The four year graduate degree programme of the Faculty is being run as per the guidelines of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. Students have the option to choose electives in the second year of the programme. Course modules like Rural Agriculture Work Experience & Agro-industrial Attachment and the experiential learning programme give the students a hands-on experience and confidence to face the real life challenges in their agri-en-trepreneurial endeavours. Growth and development of agriculture is important for overall economic development as the expansion of market for industrial goods and ser-vices hinges on agriculture growth. Agriculture would continue to require trained human re-source in its various sub-disciplines, especially scientific agriculture. Agri-graduates would thus have a variety of career choices with lucrative compensa-tion packages.
School of Agriculture
Being an agro-based economy, India has made rapid strides in agriculture sector. Efforts are being made to improve food production in the country and doubling farmer’s income through diversified farming coupled with product processing. The need is to associate processing units along with the farm produce so that the farmers, particularly in hilly areas, are able to raise their economic status. Modern agriculture practices, however, have emerged as highly knowledge based systems. Accordingly, our farmers require agriculture education at all le
vels so that they are better equipped to handle various challeng-es, especially that of globalization. We are committed to produce able agriculture scientists and engineers, who are well equipped to meet the challenges of climate change and nascent second green revolution.Faculty MembersAdjunct FacultyProf SC Tewari, PhD, (Agricultural Economics)Prof DR Sharma, PhD (Genetics)Prof UK Kohli, PhD (Vegetable Sciences)Faculty of Agriculture
